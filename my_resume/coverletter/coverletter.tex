\makelettertitle
Australia is renowned for being a global hub for the energy and mining industries, 
known for its innovation and advanced technology in production processes. 
Through my in-depth research into the undergraduate opportunities within these industries, 
including attending career fairs and engaging with company representatives, 
\companyname\space has stood out to me as a leader in the field due to the global scale of its operations 
and its strong commitment to sustainability and innovation. Whenever I speak with \companyname\space professionals, 
I am inspired by their passion and enthusiasm for the work they do.

As an undergraduate \textbf{Mechatronics/Aerospace student},
 I bring proven technical skills at the intersection of robotics, computer science, systems engineering,
 and electrical engineering. I have always been highly interested in the opportunity to contribute to \companynameâ€™s 
 innovative work in robotics and mining through this internship position since I started my engineering career.

 As I progress through my third year at QUT, I recognize that undergraduate engineers need both academic knowledge 
 and hands-on experience. This has driven me to actively seek opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge. 
 I have participated in various projects, both individually and as part of a team, and have been recognized for my academic 
 efforts, including earning the \textbf{Dean\'s Commendation} and being part of the \textbf{QUT Dean\'s Scholars program and College of 
 Excellence}. I take pride in my practical, hands-on projects, which address specific needs and showcase my achievements.

During my recent internship with the QUT Motorsport team, I was part of the Driverless subteam, 
which is responsible for designing autonomous driving systems for the team's electric 
race car. My primary responsibility involved updating and maintaining the 
ROS 2 controller system, also maintaining the system communication protocols via CANBUS, 
these are critical components of the vehicle's autonomous capabilities. 
This role required me to quickly acquire and apply knowledge beyond my formal education 
while also enhancing my programming skills in \textbf{C++, Python, XML}, and deepening my 
understanding of embedded systems. As a result of these efforts, the \textbf{vehicle's 
performance improved by 20\%}
compared to its previous version,measured during the track testing session, with an \textbf{on-time task completion rate of 95\%}.



I deeply value every opportunity to contribute to engineering and foster my personal growth. 
My work experience, combined with my academic background, makes me an ideal candidate for the internship role at \companyname. 
I can be easily reached via email or phone, as provided in the footer of this letter. 
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further. Thank you for your time and consideration.
