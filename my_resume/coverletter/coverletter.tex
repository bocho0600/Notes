Australia is renowned for being a global hub for the energy and mining industries, 
known for its innovation and advanced technology in production processes. 
Through my in-depth research into the undergraduate opportunities within these industries, 
including attending career fairs and engaging with company representatives, 
\companyname\space has stood out to me as a leader in the field due to the global scale of its operations 
and its strong commitment to sustainability and innovation. Whenever I speak with \companyname\space professionals,

As an undergraduate \textbf{Mechatronics/Aerospace student},
 I bring proven technical skills at the intersection of robotics, computer science, systems engineering,

 As I progress through my third year of an Mechatronics degree at QUT, 
 I recognize that undergraduate engineers are not only the future of the industry but 
 also require hands-on, practical experience alongside the academics. 
 This has driven me to continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge, skills, 
 and experience in the field. 
 As a result, I have actively participated in various projects both as a team and individually, highlighted in my resume. 
 I take pride in my individual projects, which are highly practical and hands-on, 
 designed to address specific project needs.

In my recent role, I was envolved in a system department team that was responsible for the 
autonomous system on a car, which was a part of the QUT Motorsport team.
I was responsible for sys of the system,
